<h1>Skate-Budapest</h1>

iOS app that shows the skateparks, skate spots and skateshops located in Budapest. In the last few years many new skateparks being built which is a very good news for anyone doing extreme sports. Compared to the 3-4 skateparks in ~2010, we have over 15 skateparks now and this number is growing steadily.

This app is for everyone who wants to visualise extreme sport related things on a map, especially skaters from abroad who has no idea where to start in Budapest.
